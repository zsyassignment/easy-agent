/**
 * Device-isolation inventory must fail CLOSED for mojo.
 *
 * Two independent fail-open holes are pinned here, both behavioural (no source
 * string assertions): revert either production change and a case below goes red.
 *
 * 1. An unreadable session store must refuse the isolation proof, not silently
 *    behave like "no sessions exist".
 * 2. An active mojo row must be surfaced even when pid/cliSessionId are absent,
 *    because MojoBackend.runTurn spawns a credentialed local child every turn.
