/**
 * Source-lock for the Codex hook-trust bypass + RPC-viewer wiring.
 *
 * The behavioral half (does the flag appear for the 4 toggle×restricted combos;
 * does the --remote viewer stay flag-free) is covered by the adapter matrix in
 * cli-adapters.test.ts. But that only proves "buildArgs behaves when handed the
 * right opts" — it can't catch the worker handing it the WRONG opts. That is
 * exactly the class of bug the a0fa71010 sandbox refactor introduced: it silently
 * dropped `remoteWsUrl`/`remoteThreadId` from the worker's buildArgs call, so the
 * `--remote` early-return never fired and RPC panes spawned a plain TUI. A pure
 * adapter test stayed green through that regression.
 *
 * These assertions pin the REAL worker→buildArgs wiring so re-dropping any field
 * turns red. Region-scoped to the single buildArgs call so a delete anywhere in
 * that argument object fails.
 *
 * Negative-verified during authoring: removing any of the three lines
 * (bypassHookTrust / remoteWsUrl / remoteThreadId) fails this file.
