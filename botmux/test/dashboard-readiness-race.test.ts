/**
 * Regression tests for the dashboard readiness race.
 *
 * OBSERVED IN PRODUCTION on a 13-member fleet: `botmux restart` waited 6s for the
 * dashboard, but the dashboard needed ~45s to start answering (supervisor up at
 * 14:23:04, `.dashboard-port` written at 14:23:49). So restart always printed its
 * "still booting" fallback, and the operator's natural next step —
 * `botmux dashboard` — reported
 *
 *     dashboard process not reachable on 127.0.0.1:7891 — `botmux restart` will start it
 *
 * Following that advice restarts a daemon that is coming up perfectly well,
 * throwing away the boot that was about to finish. Nothing was broken; the
 * waiting policy and the message were.
