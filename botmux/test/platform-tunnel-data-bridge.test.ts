/**
 * The platform tunnel's data channel: WebSocket ↔ local dashboard TCP bridge.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS — a shipped bug with a very misleading signature. The
 * bridge used `createWebSocketStream()` from `ws`, which **throws
 * `Error("Not supported yet in Bun")`**. The compiled single binary runs on Bun,
 * so on any binary install:
 *
 *  • the CONTROL channel connected fine (`new WebSocket` works on Bun), the log
 *    said 「隧道已连接平台」and the platform listed the machine as online;
 *  • but every request that actually needed forwarding died in the bridge, so the
 *    platform-side Dashboard was unreachable — while `http://<lan-ip>:<port>`
 *    worked perfectly, because a direct hit never touches the tunnel.
 *
 * That asymmetry ("dev mode works, the binary doesn't") is the fingerprint, and
 * no existing test caught it: the unit suite runs under whatever runtime the
 * runner uses, and nothing exercised the bridge end to end.
 *
 * So these tests bridge REAL sockets — a real WebSocketServer, a real TCP server —
 * and assert bytes make the round trip, against the PRODUCTION bridge imported from
 * `src/` (see the note above `startBridgingWsServer`).
 *
 * ⚠️ Scope, stated honestly: every test here runs on whatever runtime vitest uses,
 * which is Node — and `spawnSyncTsEvalWithRepoImports` children inherit that, so the
 * out-of-process test is Node too (MEASURED: the child reports `node v22.21.1`).
 * Nothing in this file executes under Bun. The Bun-specific facts that motivated the
 * fix (`createWebSocketStream` throws; `pause()`/`bufferedAmount`/`send()` callbacks
 * are all unusable; FIN-time `terminate()` truncates at volume) were measured by hand
 * and are guarded here by SOURCE-SHAPE assertions, not by behaviour.
