/**
 * `hook-command.ts` — the hook invocation must work in BOTH forms.
 *
 * WHY: these strings are handed to OTHER processes. `hookCommandFor` and friends
 * land in `~/.claude/settings.json` (and the process-level `--settings`), where
 * Claude Code — plus grok and opencode through the same helpers — read them back
 * and run them through a shell. The compiled single-file binary broke every one
 * of them, two ways over, both MEASURED on a real `bun build --compile` binary:
 *
 *   1. `join(__dirname,'..','cli.js')` yields `/$bunfs/cli.js`, and `/$bunfs/` is
 *      visible ONLY inside the process that owns it — a child sees nothing.
 *   2. The result is embedded in a double-quoted shell word, and `sh` expands the
 *      unescaped `$bunfs` to the empty string, so `"/$bunfs/cli.js"` resolves to
 *      `//cli.js` — not even the literal path.
 *
 * The user-visible symptom is the nastiest kind: running the old compiled form
 * through `sh` prints the botmux HELP BANNER and exits 0 (verified against a real
 * binary), so hooks silently do nothing and nothing anywhere reports an error.
 *
 * HOW THESE TESTS GET TEETH: `isStandaloneBinary()` is called for real, not
 * mocked — it keys off `process.argv[1]` starting with `/$bunfs/` (see
 * src/core/self-spawn.ts), so pointing argv[1] at a `/$bunfs/` path exercises the
 * genuine branch. That matters because the repo's other compiled-mode tests pass
 * a `standalone` flag in as a parameter; here the decision is internal, so a
 * parameter could not reach it.
 *
 * The Node-form cases are equally load-bearing: the fix must not "converge" the
 * two forms, because Node genuinely NEEDS the script path (verified: `node hook
 * claude-code` without it dies with MODULE_NOT_FOUND). Branching is correct here;
 * collapsing it would be the bug.
