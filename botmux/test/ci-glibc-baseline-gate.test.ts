/**
 * The Linux glibc FLOOR is a shipped-artifact property that nothing in the
 * packaging metadata can express.
 *
 * `pty.node` is embedded into the binary at compile time and node-pty has no linux
 * prebuild, so it is compiled against whatever glibc the BUILDER runs. When
 * `ubuntu-latest` moved to 24.04 the shipped floor silently rose to GLIBC_2.34 —
 * nothing failed at build time, nothing failed on the runner, and the binary died
 * at dlopen on any host older than that (Debian 10 / CentOS 8, both still inside
 * Node 22's own glibc 2.28 support window).
 *
 * Two properties therefore have to hold, and neither is visible in a normal test:
 *   1. PRODUCTION: Linux binaries are built on glibc 2.28 and the embedded native's
 *      highest required GLIBC symbol is asserted before it can be published.
 *   2. PARITY: the PR gate exercises the same boundary as release, so a floor
 *      regression is caught on the PR that causes it rather than after publish.
 *
 * WHAT THESE TESTS DEFEND: not the YAML's shape, but the claim "a Linux release
 * cannot ship a native whose glibc floor exceeds 2.28, and the PR gate proves it".
 * Every assertion corresponds to a change that would leave the rest of the suite
 * green while silently un-gating the floor:
 *   • ci.yml stops using the baseline builder  → back to release-only discovery
 *   • release.yml stops using it (e.g. every
 *     `glibc_baseline` blanked back to '')     → Linux ships from ubuntu-latest
 *                                                again, which is THIS bug
 *   • the readelf floor assertion goes away    → builds on 2.28 but no longer
 *                                                proves what it produced
 *   • the built binary is never executed       → compiles but the native is never
 *                                                dlopen'd, and dlopen is the
 *                                                failure mode
 *
 * MEASURED, and the reason this file exists: blanking all three `glibc_baseline`
 * values in release.yml reverts Linux releases to the broken path, and the 27
 * install/release/binary suites stay at 471/471 green.
 *
 * Deliberately parsed as text rather than YAML, and with comments stripped: the
 * assertions are about specific commands being present, and neither a structurally
 * valid file that runs something else nor prose ABOUT the gate can satisfy them.
 *
 * Sibling suite: test/ci-musl-gate.test.ts guards the structurally identical
 * "wrong libc embedded in a shipped native" hazard for musl. Its MECHANISM vs MEANS
 * note applies here too — assert the invariant (built on the floor, floor proven,
 * binary executed), not the means (docker, manylinux, a particular image).
