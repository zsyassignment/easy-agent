/**
 * Guards the `vi.*` / `it.*` helpers that `test/bun-test-shim.ts` fills in under
 * `bun test`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the shim's whole risk is *semantic drift* — a fill that
 * returns without reproducing the real effect turns a loud failure into a silent
 * false green. This repo already paid for that once (an ad-hoc `vi.stubEnv` shim
 * made the suite green while it kept writing to the developer's real
 * `~/.botmux`). So each shimmed behaviour is asserted here rather than assumed.
 *
 * Deliberately runs under BOTH runners: under vitest these assertions describe
 * the reference semantics, and under `bun test` they check the shim reproduces
 * them. A change that makes the two diverge fails on one side.
