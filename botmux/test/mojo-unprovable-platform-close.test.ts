/**
 * "The platform can never prove it" is not the same failure as "it should have been
 * provable and was not", and collapsing the two produces a permanent wedge.
 *
 * On a host with no /proc the subtree scan answers `unsupported-platform` forever.
 * Routed into the latched write fence, that means: every /close fails, every retry
 * fails for the same unchangeable reason, and write() never returns true again — the
 * session becomes impossible to close AND impossible to use. Nothing in that state
 * is evidence of a surviving process; it is evidence that we cannot look.
 *
 * `alive` (a positive sighting) and `unscannable` (a transient/partial read failure
 * on a host that normally CAN enumerate) are the opposite: a credentialed process
 * may be running right now, and a retry can genuinely change the answer, so both
 * must keep the fence.
 *
 * Both directions are pinned here because each has a matching mutation:
 *   - latch unsupported-platform too  -> the wedge returns
 *   - let unscannable close as residual -> a live subtree's row closes
 *
 * Run:  pnpm vitest run test/mojo-unprovable-platform-close.test.ts
