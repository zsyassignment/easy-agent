/**
 * REAL worker -> real IPC -> real daemon -> durable journal, for the close
 * prepare fences.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The existing mojo close coverage (test/mojo-explicit-close.test.ts) starts at
 * the DAEMON message: its fake worker is an EventEmitter that synthesizes
 * `close_result` payloads, `recovery` field included. That is fine for the
 * daemon's decision, but it means the entire PRODUCER side is unverified — the
 * test hands the daemon the very field the worker is supposed to compute. Four
 * separate regressions therefore survived the whole suite:
 *
 *   1. worker.ts, thrown destroySession:   recovery 'uncertain' -> 'retryable'
 *   2. destroy-result.ts, the send site:   drop `recovery` from the payload
 *   3. worker-pool.ts, worker exited:      recovery 'uncertain' -> 'retryable'
 *   4. worker-pool.ts, close timeout:      recovery 'uncertain' -> 'retryable'
 *
 * Each of those turns an UNKNOWN teardown outcome back into a rollback: the
 * daemon sends `close_abort`, write admission re-opens, and the durable journal
 * is cleared — on a session whose remote cancellation may already have
 * completed (irreversible) or may still be in flight under an id we never
 * learned (an unnamed orphan still holding the injected credential).
 *
 * The assertions below are deliberately made on the two OBSERVABLE consequences
 * rather than on the enum value, because the caller-visible return
 * (`ok:false, error:'mojo_cancel_failed', retryable:true`) is identical either
 * way:
 *   - was `close_abort` sent over the real IPC channel?
 *   - is the durable journal ON DISK still there after closeSession() returns?
 *     (a fenced verdict retains it; a rollback clears it — see
 *     expectDurableFence for why the phase is matched as a set)
 *
 * Run:  pnpm vitest run test/mojo-close-worker-journal.integration.test.ts

 *
 * WHY NOT readFileSync -- this was a real hole, not a style preference
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This helper used to parse the projection file directly, with a comment
 * claiming it saw "exactly what a restarting daemon would". That claim was
 * false, and it cost coverage: deleting the save() inside
 * mutateMojoCloseJournal left every assertion here GREEN, because
 * closeSession's path has other writers (updateSession via
 * reserveWorkerGeneration / persistStreamCardState) that flush the very same
 * shared Session object. The row really was in the file -- just not because the
 * journal mutation put it there. Textbook coincidental coverage.
 *
 * Re-initialising the store fixes it for a concrete reason: it drops the
 * in-memory map and replays the on-disk projection, so a field that was only
 * ever set on the shared object -- and flushed by a foreign writer that ran
 * BEFORE the journal was written -- is simply absent on reload. The no-save
 * mutant is therefore killed here (verified 3/3 on the `recovery` assertion in
