/**
 * A residual close must still refuse new writes.
 *
 * This is the one invariant that falls between two owners, so it was explicitly
 * handed over rather than assumed: the containment layer guarantees "the session
 * is never reported clean" (its unprovable handle can never be released, so the
 * device-isolation blocker survives), but it does NOT govern write admission. And
 * the platform-residual close deliberately does NOT latch the write fence — that
 * latch is exactly what produced the permanent wedge on hosts with no /proc.
 *
 * So on the residual path nothing that normally refuses writes is in play: the
 * fence is intentionally absent and the containment blocker cannot help. If the
 * session still accepted a turn afterwards, a credentialed subtree we cannot
 * enumerate would be sharing a session with fresh work — which is the exact hazard
 * the fence exists to prevent, reached by a different route.
 *
 * WHICH GUARD DOES WHAT — measured, not inferred; read before editing asserts
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * write() refuses on `killed || closing || shutdownDetaching`, and the residual
 * close sets TWO of them. Measured flag matrix on this path:
 *
 *              AFTER CLOSE                  AFTER A LATER abortDestroySession()
 *   clean      killed=1 closing=1 -> refused    killed=1 closing=1 -> refused
 *   no killed  killed=0 closing=1 -> refused    killed=0 closing=0 -> ADMITTED
 *   no closing killed=1 closing=0 -> refused    killed=1 closing=0 -> refused
 *
 * Two consequences that decide where the assertions go:
 *
 * 1. Straight after the close, BOTH flags are set and either alone refuses. So an
 *    assertion at that moment cannot observe either flag individually — dropping
 *    `killed` leaves it green. That is measured, not assumed, and it is why this
 *    test asserts a SECOND time after an abort.
 * 2. Only `killed` governs the post-abort moment: abortDestroySession() begins
 *    with `if (this.killed) return;`, so without it the abort proceeds and clears
 *    `closing`, admitting the next turn onto a subtree this platform cannot
 *    enumerate. The post-abort assertion is the ONLY coverage of `killed` here;
 *    remove it and that guarantee is unguarded again.
 *
 * Also recorded so nobody "adds coverage" for it and reports a kill: dropping
 * `closing` alone is an EQUIVALENT mutation with respect to write admission,
 * because `killed` already refuses at both moments. `closing` earns its keep
 * elsewhere (it gates the window before the close completes), not here.
 *
