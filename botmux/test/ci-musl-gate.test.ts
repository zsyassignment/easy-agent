/**
 * The musl (Alpine) binary is a SHIPPED artifact whose native differs from every
 * other platform's: `pty.node` is embedded at compile time and node-pty has no
 * linux prebuild, so it is compiled against whatever libc the builder runs on. A
 * glibc native inside a musl binary builds cleanly and fails only when the native
 * is dlopen'd — on the user's machine.
 *
 * That artifact was originally gated ONLY in release.yml, which runs on tag push.
 * So a PR could change the build script, the embed plugin, or node-pty's version
 * and the musl leg was first exercised during a release, after npm had published.
 * ci.yml now carries a musl job too.
 *
 * WHAT THESE TESTS DEFEND: not the YAML's shape, but the claim "the PR gate is not
 * weaker than the release gate for musl". Every assertion below corresponds to a
 * step whose removal would leave CI green while silently un-gating musl:
 *   • no musl job at all              → back to release-only discovery
 *   • builds a non-musl target        → gates the wrong artifact
 *   • no readelf linkage check        → a glibc native ships inside a musl binary
 *   • no smoke run                    → compiles but never executes it (and the
 *     smoke run is what proves the native LOADS — see the dlopen note below)
 *
 * Deliberately parsed as text rather than YAML: the assertions are about specific
 * commands being present, and a text match cannot be satisfied by a structurally
 * valid file that runs something else.

  // `container:` WAS the P0: on an arm64 runner it makes actions/checkout fail
  // outright, and v3.18.0-canary.4's release died on it. That assertion had locked
  // the defect in as the expected shape, so fixing the bug REQUIRED reversing it.
  //
  // Reverse-mutation cannot catch this: an assertion pinning a wrong implementation
  // is indistinguishable from one pinning a right one — both go red when deleted.
  // The lesson is to assert the INVARIANT (the build happens on musl, and we prove
  // the native is musl-linked) rather than the MEANS of achieving it. The means-level
