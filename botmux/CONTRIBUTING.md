# Contributing to botmux

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepcoldy/botmux.git
cd botmux
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build

# Run directly (no PM2)
bun run daemon

# Or with PM2
bun run daemon:start
bun run daemon:logs
```

> Every code change requires `bun run build` then `bun run daemon:restart`.

> **Package manager is [bun](https://bun.sh)** (`packageManager: bun@1.4.0`,
> lockfile `bun.lock`). `trustedDependencies` in `package.json` must keep
> `node-pty`: bun does not run dependency lifecycle scripts by default, and
> `node-pty` needs its install hook to build `build/Release/pty.node` — without
> it the PTY layer is dead and the compiled single-file binary cannot be built.
> The list is deliberately just `["electron","node-pty"]` (identical to the
> `onlyBuiltDependencies` it replaced) — don't "complete" it by adding esbuild:
> its binary comes from the `@esbuild/<platform>` package, not its postinstall.
>
> This is about *building botmux from source*. How **end users install botmux**
> is a separate matter — `pnpm i -g botmux` is still a supported install path
> (see `InstallKind` in `src/utils/install-diagnostics.ts`), so don't "convert"
> those to bun.

## CLI-Agent Interaction (Skills + CLI subcommands)

botmux exposes its Lark-interaction surface as **CLI subcommands**
(`botmux send`, `botmux schedule`, `botmux bots`,
`botmux thread messages`) paired with auto-installed **Skills** that
teach the agent when/how to use them.

**Runtime setup per CLI worker spawn** (see `src/core/worker-pool.ts`):

1. `ensureCliSkills(cliId)` — writes `src/skills/definitions.ts` content
   into the CLI's native skill dir (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.gemini/skills/`,
   `~/.config/opencode/skills/`). Synchronous, idempotent per lifecycle.
2. Worker `PATH` is prepended with `~/.botmux/bin`, which contains a
   `botmux` shell wrapper written by the daemon at startup (points at the
   running daemon's `dist/cli.js` — always in sync).
3. `--append-system-prompt` flag injects the routing instruction
   ("user reads Lark, not terminal — use `botmux send` for user-facing content")
   into each CLI session.
4. Every user message carries a per-message hint (`[回复请用 botmux send]`)
   appended in `buildFollowUpContent` to keep the instruction near the attention
   window even in long conversations.

### CLI subcommands (agent-facing)

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `botmux send [content]` | Send message to current thread (stdin / heredoc / `--content-file`; `--images` / `--files` / `--videos` / `--mention` flags) |
| `botmux bots list` | List bots in current chat with their `open_id`s |
| `botmux thread messages [--limit N]` | Fetch thread message history (JSON) |
| `botmux schedule add <schedule> <prompt>` | Create scheduled task bound to current thread |
| `botmux schedule list/remove/pause/resume/run` | Manage tasks |

All agent-facing subcommands auto-detect session context by walking the
process tree looking for a CLI-pid marker written by the worker
(`{dataDir}/.botmux-cli-pids/{pid}`). Works across every CLI that can
spawn child processes — no extra protocol support required from the CLI.

## Adding a New CLI Adapter

1. Create a new file in `src/adapters/cli/`, implementing the `CliAdapter` interface
2. Add the new ID to the `CliId` type in `src/adapters/cli/types.ts`
3. Add a case to the switch in `src/adapters/cli/registry.ts`
4. Set `"cliId": "<new-id>"` in `bots.json` to use it

> Full checklist — display names, setup choices, README updates:
> see [`src/adapters/cli/CLAUDE.md`](src/adapters/cli/CLAUDE.md).

The `CliAdapter` interface requires:

| Method / Property | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique CLI identifier |
| `resolvedBin` | Path to the CLI binary |
| `buildArgs()` | Construct CLI launch arguments |
| `writeInput()` | Write user input to the PTY (handles multi-line, Enter key timing) |
| `skillsDir` | Absolute path to the CLI's skills directory (optional; Skills only installed when set) |
| `completionPattern` | Regex to detect when a turn is complete (optional) |
| `readyPattern` | Regex to detect when the CLI is ready for input (optional) |
| `systemHints` | System-level hints injected into the CLI (optional) |
| `altScreen` | Whether the CLI uses alternate screen mode |
| `modelChoices` | Curated model candidates surfaced in `botmux setup` (optional). Set when the CLI accepts a model flag (consumed in `buildArgs` via the `model` opt); omit when the CLI has no `--model` concept — setup then skips the model prompt for that CLI |

## Tests

Tests are split into two Vitest projects with different execution profiles
(see `vitest.config.ts`):

- **`unit`** (`*.test.ts`) — pure, filesystem-mocked or temp-dir-isolated.
  Runs with **file parallelism on** (one process per file). This is what
  `bun run test` runs, so the default is fast (~10s) and needs no real CLI binary
  or browser.
- **`e2e`** (`*.e2e.ts`) — spawns real CLIs / drives the Feishu web UI through a
  shared daemon, so files run **sequentially**. Opt-in only.

```bash
bun run test                # Unit tests only — parallel, ~10s (default)
bun run test:all            # Unit + E2E (needs real CLIs / browser session)
bun run test:e2e            # All *.e2e.ts (sequential)
bun run test:codex          # Codex input E2E
bun run test:gemini         # Gemini CLI input E2E
bun run test:bench          # Benchmark the unit suite (see docs/test-benchmark.md)
bun run test:bench --compare   # serial vs parallel vs parallel+time-scale table
```

> **Speed knob:** adapter `writeInput()` waits real wall-clock time to confirm a
> submit (poll the CLI history/transcript). `BOTMUX_TIME_SCALE` (read by
> `src/utils/timing.ts`, default `1` = unchanged in production) multiplies every
> such delay. Filesystem-mocked unit tests set it small to collapse those waits.
> See [`docs/test-benchmark.md`](docs/test-benchmark.md).

### Timing-Sensitive Test Contract

- Treat a test fixture's `ready` handshake as a happens-before barrier, not a
  progress log: publish it only after every handler, listener, resource, and
  durable state needed by the parent's next action is installed.
- Establish preconditions and postconditions through the exact observable event
  or state under assertion. Do not infer sibling or downstream telemetry from a
  lifecycle event unless its contract explicitly orders them. Fixed sleeps may
  model intentional timing or bound a hang, but must not stand in for readiness.
- Make scheduler-sensitive ordering deterministic in the fixture. Widen a
  timeout only for proven slow-but-progressing work, and never use retries to
  mask a missing barrier or known race.
- Keep every wait bounded and make timeout errors identify the unmet condition.
