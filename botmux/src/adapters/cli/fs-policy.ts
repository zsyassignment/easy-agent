/**
 * Unified file-sandbox policy (FsPolicy) — the single source of truth for BOTH
 * platform sandbox engines.
 *
 * Model (three-tier whitelist, per product decision 2026-07-16, design doc
 * "botmux 文件沙盒重构方案"): every path gets one of three access levels —
 * readWrite / readOnly / deny — and EVERYTHING NOT COVERED BY A RULE IS
 * INACCESSIBLE (deny-by-default). Nested black/white lists are supported: the
 * DEEPEST matching rule wins (longest-prefix), so `readOnly ~/Library` +
 * `deny ~/Library/Keychains` and `deny bots/` + `readWrite bots/<self>` both
 * work. This replaces the previous "read-everything + enumerated blocklist"
 * model whose failure mode was silent secret exposure; here a missing baseline
 * entry fails loud (CLI error), never silent.
 *
 * Architecture: this module is PURE (no fs / no spawn — fully unit-testable).
 *   buildFsPolicy(ctx)      merges baseline preset + botmux-internal + adapter
 *                           + user rules into one ordered rule list
 *   compileToSeatbelt(...)  → macOS sandbox-exec profile text
 *   compileToBwrap(...)     → Linux bwrap argv prefix
 * Both engines resolve conflicts by "last emitted wins" (Seatbelt last-match /
 * bwrap mount order), so emitting rules sorted shallow→deep yields
 * longest-prefix-wins on BOTH platforms by construction — cross-platform
 * parity needs no hand-synced rule lists.
 *
 * The worker resolves every impure input up front (realpath, existence
 * filtering, sibling-free by design) and passes canonical absolute paths.

/**
 * Which adapter `authPaths` survive a CLI-data redirect into BOT_HOME.
 *
 * When a bot redirects its CLI data (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/CODEX_HOME → BOT_HOME),
 * the adapter's REAL host data dir is rehomed: the isolated copy under BOT_HOME
 * is what the CLI reads/writes, and the host dir is denied-by-default (its
 * exposure was the whole point of read isolation). Any authPath that lives
 * INSIDE such a rehomed host root is therefore either (a) redundant — its
 * BOT_HOME equivalent is provisioned + covered readWrite by the botHome rule
 * (claude `.credentials.json`), or (b) an active leak we must NOT expose (codex's
 * whole `~/.codex`: history.jsonl, sessions/, state_*.sqlite). Both are dropped.
 *
 * But authPaths that live OUTSIDE every rehomed root are external login sources
 * the redirect does NOT rehome — e.g. Seed/Relay's `~/.local/share/bytedcli` SSO
 * dir (bytedcli login reuse). Dropping those regresses login (a fresh BOT_HOME /
 * expired token cold-start would have no credential source). They MUST survive.
 *
 * NOTE this is a SUPPRESSION-vs-KEEP decision only. A path inside a rehomed root
 * whose BOT_HOME copy is NOT provisioned (e.g. `<dataDir>/byted-cloud-auth.json`
 * — never seeded, and never the redirected read location since the CLI resolves
 * it under $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=BOT_HOME) is still dropped: keeping the host path
 * would not help the redirected read anyway. Provisioning such files into
 * BOT_HOME is a separate concern (see provisionIsolatedBotHome), orthogonal to
 * closing the host-dir leak this filter exists for.
 *
 * @param authPaths     adapter authPaths, already `~`-expanded + normalized absolute
 * @param rehomedRoots  host data roots being redirected to BOT_HOME, normalized
