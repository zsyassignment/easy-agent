/**
 * MojoBackend — API-backed SessionBackend for @byted/mojo.
 *
 * Implements botmux's pseudo-PTY SessionBackend surface on top of mojo's
 * headless mode, in the same spirit as RiffBackend. Verified empirically
 * against @byted/mojo 1.0.10 (linux-x64).
 *
 * ── Why not a TUI adapter (kimi/grok style) ──────────────────────────────────
 *  1. `--yolo` / `-r` / `-c` / `--output-format` / `--timeout` / `--idle-timeout`
 *     are all "仅 -p" (headless only). Passing them without `-p` does not launch
 *     a TUI — the process just blocks on stdin until EOF.
 *  2. mojo keeps NO local per-session transcript (`~/.mojo` holds only
 *     credentials/ memory/ skills/; session state is server-side), so the
 *     grok-style "tail updates.jsonl for turn end" bridge is impossible and only
 *     unreliable screen-scraping would remain.
 *
 * ── Why foreground streaming and not `--background` + polling ────────────────
 * `--background` looks attractive (instant id, ask_user/confirm interactions,
 * survives restarts) but it is CREATE-ONLY — verified:
 *     mojo -p --background -r <sid>  → error invalid_argument "--background 不支持：--resume"
 *     mojo -p --background -c        → error invalid_argument "--background 不支持：--continue"
 * A chat bot is inherently multi-turn, so a create-only submit path would start a
 * fresh context-less session on every IM message. Foreground `-p -r <sid>` does
 * resume correctly (including sessions originally created by --background), and
 * additionally gives real token-level streaming plus an exact turn boundary.
 *
 * The cost, made explicit so it isn't discovered in production: in foreground
 * mode mojo AUTO-SKIPS ask_user and cancels the turn —
 *     warnings: ["agent 的提问（ask-user）在非交互模式下被自动跳过"]
 *     error: {code:"cancelled"}, exit code 1
 * We detect exactly that and tell the user to supply the missing detail, instead
 * of leaving them with a silently empty turn. See ASK_USER_SKIPPED_RE.
 *
 * ── Event stream (`-p --output-format stream-json --include-partial`) ────────
 *   {type:"system", subtype:"init", session_id, model}   ← id available up-front
 *   {type:"text_delta", text}                            ← incremental
 *   {type:"text", text}                                  ← whole segment
 *   {type:"tool_call", id, name, input}
 *   {type:"result", status, result, session_id, duration_ms, num_tool_calls,
 *                  warnings, error}                      ← exact turn boundary
 *
 * NOTE: the foreground envelope is NOT the same shape as the `--background` /
 * `session.*` schema-v1 envelope (which additionally carries schema_version,
 * operation, state, turn_id, result_complete, interaction). Never assume `state`
 * or `result_complete` exists on a foreground result. Also `error` is an OBJECT
 * ({code, message, retryable}), not a string.
