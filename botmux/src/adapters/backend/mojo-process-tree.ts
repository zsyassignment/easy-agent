/**
 * Which processes still belong to a mojo turn, and are they gone yet?
 *
 * Why a PGID is not enough
 * ------------------------
 * Signalling `-pgid` looked sufficient, but a descendant can call `setsid()` (or
 * be spawned with `detached: true`) and become the leader of a NEW group and
 * session. It then survives every `kill(-pgid)` aimed at the original group while
 * still holding the inherited `X_JWT_TOKEN`. Reparenting to init also destroys the
 * PPID chain once the direct child exits, so neither PGID nor parentage alone can
 * enumerate the subtree.
 *
 * The three signals below are therefore unioned, because each covers the others'
 * blind spot:
 *   - PGID           the common case, and the only one that works before /proc
 *                    has been read
 *   - env nonce      a unique value injected into the turn's environment. It is
 *                    inherited by every descendant and survives setsid, a new
 *                    session, and reparenting to init
 *   - PPID chain     catches a descendant that scrubbed its own environ but is
 *                    still parented inside the tree
 *
 * Trust domain: this is a DIAGNOSTIC SIGNAL, not a boundary
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * A hijacked child runs as the same user, so a descendant that both setsids AND
 * overwrites its own environ area can still evade enumeration. Reading a clean
 * scan as "the credential is now unreachable" is therefore unsound, and the type
 * system now says so: a successful scan is stamped `evidence: 'diagnostic'`, and
 * `quiescenceFromScan()` maps even an EMPTY member list to
 * `{ kind: 'diagnostic-clean', boundaryProof: false }`. Only a kernel-level
 * container (per-session cgroup v2 / pid namespace, see mojo-containment) can
 * produce `boundaryProof: true`. Callers must keep the session's
 * device-isolation blocker whenever `boundaryProof` is false — including the
 * clean-scan case.
 *
 * Fail-closed
 * -----------
 * Only ENOENT means "this pid exited between readdir and read", which is a
 * genuine non-member and safe to skip. EVERY other read or parse error means the
 * table we built is incomplete, and an incomplete table can hide a survivor, so
 * it fails the WHOLE scan instead of silently shrinking the result. The one
 * documented exception is EACCES/EPERM on `environ` (see readEnviron).
