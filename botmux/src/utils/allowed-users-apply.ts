/**
 * Decide how to apply a startup / refresh resolve of allowedUsers.
 *
 * Runtime permission (canTalk/canOperate) only matches app-scoped open_ids
 * (`ou_…`). Config may store stable `on_…` / emails that must be resolved each
 * boot. A transient contact API failure used to overwrite the runtime list with
 * `[]`, which fail-closed locks out even the real owner with almost no signal.
 *
 * This module merges the fresh resolve with a last-known-good `raw → ou_` cache,
 * but ONLY per-entry and ONLY when that entry both (a) transient-failed this
 * pass and (b) is still present in the current raw config. That guards against
 * two revival hazards a bare `ou_[]` fallback list would create:
 *   - config swaps owner `on_old → on_new`, contact API blips → `ou_old` would
 *     be resurrected from cache even though the operator removed it;
 *   - an owner is definitively removed from the tenant (errored=false,
 *     resolved=[]) → they would be revived indefinitely.
 * The cache is keyed by raw entry, so an entry no longer in config, or one that
 * resolved definitively-gone, is never reused.
