// Dashboard-side `.env` loading, narrowed to an ALLOWLIST.
//
// ~/.botmux/.env is a general-purpose operator file: besides botmux settings it
// routinely holds unrelated credentials (LARK_APP_SECRET for the legacy
// single-bot mode, GITHUB_TOKEN, model API keys, whatever the host's tooling
// wants). index-dashboard.ts used to dotenv-load that file WHOLESALE into
// process.env, and the dashboard process is the worst place in the fleet for
// that: it forks debug-terminal shells, `botmux start-bot/stop-bot` children,
// a global npm/pnpm/bun install (whose lifecycle scripts run with the inherited
// env), herdr plugin installs, and it starts plugin PM2 services — every one of
// those inherited the whole file. A secret that has no consumer in the
// dashboard must therefore never enter its process.env at all.
//
// So the entry loads the file into a side object and copies over ONLY the keys
// the dashboard actually consumes (this module's allowlist). Everything else —
// especially credentials — stays in the file. The per-boundary redaction
// (redactChildEnv / stripDashboardH5Env) remains the second layer for the keys
// the dashboard legitimately holds, most importantly the H5 login family.
//
// Adding a key here is a deliberate act: it means "the dashboard process reads
// this, and every child it forks may see it unless a boundary strips it".

/**
 * Keys the dashboard process reads from ~/.botmux/.env, beyond
 * {@link DAEMON_ENV_KEYS} (which is folded in below: every key baked into the
 * shared PM2 env block is by definition a setting the dashboard may resolve,
 * and a foreground/manual `dist/index-dashboard.js` has only the file).
 *
 * Each entry names its consumer inside the dashboard process, so a future
 * reader can verify — or delete — it:
 *  - SESSION_DATA_DIR → config.session.dataDir. The dashboard shares
 *    pairings/federations/memberships with the daemons under {dataDir}/*.json;
 *    a wrong value silently splits the store (cli.ts also bakes it).
 *  - CLI_ID / BACKEND_TYPE → config.daemon.cliId / config.daemon.backendType,
 *    the fleet-wide fallback the dashboard applies to a bot that pins neither
 *    (VC-meeting consumer isolation verdict, adapter capability probes).
 *  - BOTMUX_SCHEDULE_TIMEZONE → utils/timezone scheduleTimeZone(). The settings
 *    payload advertises `effectiveScheduleTimeZone`; dropping the env override
 *    here would make the UI report a zone the daemons do not fire in.
 *  - FEISHU_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN → utils/user-token resolveUserToken(), used by
 *    dashboard/feed-groups.ts. A credential, kept for the same reason as the H5
 *    APP_SECRET below: the dashboard is a real consumer. Not a licence to add
 *    other credentials — a key belongs here only with a named consumer.
 *  - BOTMUX_DASHBOARD_DEV_RELOAD → dashboard.ts dev-reload switch.
 *  - proxy family → outbound HTTPS from the dashboard itself (npm registry
 *    version/rollback lookups, hd2d asset download) on hosts without direct
 *    internet. These are forwarded to CLI children by design elsewhere
 *    (PROXY_ENV_KEYS), so allowing them adds no new exposure.
