/**
 * Scrub the env handed to an EXTERNAL long-lived child — a process that is not

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE BOOT SCRUBS: a bot daemon and the
 * dashboard strip these families in their OWN entrypoints (index-daemon.ts /
 * index-dashboard.ts). That works because they are our code. A plugin service is
 * an arbitrary third-party program: it inherits whatever we hand it and will
 * never delete a key on our behalf, so the strip has to happen on OUR side,
 * before the spawn.
 *
 * The set is deliberately IDENTICAL to what the pm2 path scrubbed
 * (`scrubPm2CallerEnv`), because this replaces that path — a migration must not
 * quietly reduce protection. Every family below has a measured fleet-wide
 * failure mode; see each key list for the specifics:
 *
 *   • SESSION_CLI_HOME_ENV_KEYS      one bot reading/writing a sibling's CLI home
 *   • CLAUDE_SESSION_MARKER_ENV_KEYS transcript saving flipped off fleet-wide
 *   • WORKFLOW_WORKER_ENV_KEYS       ordinary chats running in workflow mode
 *   • dashboard H5 family            the app secret persisted into child state
 *   • INVOKER_TERMINAL_ENV_KEYS      every PTY on the machine turned colorless
 *   • SESSION_TURN_MARKER_ENV_KEYS   a long-lived proc carrying one turn's identity
 *
 * The graceful-exit sentinel is stripped for the same reason the pm2 path did it
 * (stripPm2GracefulExitMarker, called by pm2Env before this scrub): it is the
 * private handshake by which OUR OWN two managed cores report a clean shutdown as
 * exit 90 instead of 0. resolveFleetDaemonEnv pins it for every supervised member,
 * so without this an external command inherits it and any foreground `botmux` it
 * launches would exit 90 on a clean stop — read back as a crash. An external
 * member must never be told that 90 means "clean". (Stripping it here does NOT by
 * itself stop the supervisor from reading a plain exit(90) as graceful; that is a
 * separate decision in fleet-supervisor-policy's decideOnExit, which never looks
 * at env. Both are required, which is why isGracefulExit is member-shape aware.)
 *
 * TERM is re-pinned rather than deleted, matching the pm2 path: deleting it
 * makes a child's supports-color detection fail and render colorless, which is
 * the same end state the invoker-terminal scrub exists to prevent.
 *
 * Mutates `env` in place.
