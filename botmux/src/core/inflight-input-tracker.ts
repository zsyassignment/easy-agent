/**
 * Tracks user inputs that have been written to the CLI's PTY but whose turn
 * hasn't completed yet (the CLI hasn't returned to its idle prompt since the
 * write). If the CLI process dies first, those inputs would otherwise vanish:
 * codex crashing mid-submit never records them in history.jsonl, the
 * auto-restarted CLI comes up idle and empty, and nothing re-delivers — the
 * user-visible symptom is a session stuck at 「等待输入」 that "never received"
 * the message (2026-06-10 incident, codex 0.137.0 exit 1 ~3s after paste).
 *
 * The worker wires it up as:
 *   - flushPending dequeues an item and writes it  → onWrite(item)
 *   - CLI returns to idle prompt (markPromptReady) → onTurnComplete()
 *   - CLI process exits (backend.onExit)           → onCliExit()
 *   - fresh CLI spawning (spawnCli, non-adopt)     → takeCarryOver() and
 *     unshift the result back into pendingMessages
 *
 * Trade-off: if the CLI accepted the input and died mid-turn, re-delivery
 * makes the restarted CLI see the prompt twice — a duplicate ask beats a
 * silently lost message. A false-idle blip mid-turn clears the in-flight set
 * early and degrades to the old lose-on-crash behavior for that turn only.
