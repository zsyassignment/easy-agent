/**
 * Maintenance timer: scheduled auto-update / auto-restart. Runs only on the
 * primary daemon (bot-0) — restart is a host-wide operation (it takes down all
 * per-bot daemons), so exactly one process must own it.
 *
 * At the scheduled local time (Asia/Shanghai, once/day) it:
 *  - checks the cross-daemon busy gate (anyDaemonBusy) — a session mid-CLI-turn
 *    anywhere defers the run to the next day (no retry);
 *  - auto-update (npm/pnpm/Bun global): update the package with its owning package
 *    manager, then restart
 *    to apply iff the version actually changed;
 *  - auto-restart: just restart.
 * Before triggering a restart it drops a restart-intent breadcrumb so the fresh
 * daemon knows to DM the owner (vs. staying silent on a crash-restart).
 *
 * runMaintenanceTick is pure over its injected deps (unit tested); the rest is
 * production wiring.

 * that silently never happened while reporting success. So in standalone mode the
 * entry argument is dropped entirely and the binary is invoked as
 * `<binary> restart`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LAUNCHER SHIM IS THE SAME CASE. `selfDispatching` is not a synonym for
 * "compiled": `~/.botmux/bin/botmux` forwards `"$@"` to whatever form is installed,
 * so it too takes the subcommand as its FIRST argument. Handing it a cli.js path

 * ⚠️ WHY `process.execPath` IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT FOR A COMPILED BINARY. For the
 * self-replacing (install.sh) shape it is exactly right: the path is stable and we
 * just swapped the bytes underneath it. But for a PACKAGE-MANAGER-owned binary the
 * running path can be VERSIONED — pnpm's virtual store yields
 * `…/.pnpm/botmux-linux-x64@<old version>/node_modules/botmux-linux-x64/botmux`.
 * After the update, npm/pnpm's postinstall has re-pointed the stable launcher at
 * the NEW subpackage, while this process's `execPath` still names the OLD one. So
 * restarting from `execPath` either fails with ENOENT (the old store entry was
 * pruned) or silently starts the OLD binary — an update that reports success and
 * does not take effect.
 *
 * The stable launcher (`~/.botmux/bin/botmux`) is what both installers maintain and
 * re-point, so it is the correct target after a package-manager update. Fall back
 * to `execPath` when it is missing (nothing else to go on) — that is the
 * pre-existing behaviour.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND `execPath` IS NOT RIGHT FOR A **NODE** PROCESS EITHER, WHEN THE UPDATE
 * IT JUST INSTALLED CHANGED THE RUNTIME FORM. This branch used to be an
 * unconditional `if (!standalone) return execPath`, i.e. `node <root>/dist/cli.js
 * restart`. Since 3.18.0 the npm package ships the CLI as a platform-subpackage
 * BINARY: `bin` is gone, `node-pty` left `dependencies`, and postinstall points the
 * launcher at the binary — but `dist/` is still published and still statically
 * imports `node-pty` (MEASURED on the published 3.18.8 tarball: 4 import chains
 * from `dist/cli.js`, 5 from `dist/worker.js`). So after a Node-form daemon
 * auto-updates itself across that boundary, the very next thing it does is spawn
 * `node <root>/dist/cli.js restart` — and npm has just PRUNED node-pty from that
 * tree (MEASURED, 3.17.0 → 3.18.6: "removed 2 packages"). The driver dies on
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and the fleet never comes back, having reported
 * "restarting to apply".
 *
 * The launcher is the right target in exactly the same way and for the same
 * reason as the npm-binary case: it is the one path the installer re-points to
 * whatever form is now correct. Prefer it whenever it exists, and keep `execPath`
 * as the fallback so a host without a launcher behaves as before.
 *
 * Pure over its inputs so every branch is testable without a compiled binary.
