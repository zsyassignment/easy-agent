 *   1. Bot added to a new chat  → spawn a session (场景① / autoStartOnGroupJoin)
 *   2. New topic in a topic group → spawn a session without @ (场景② / autoStartOnNewTopic)

 * Kept side-effect-free so the routing/spawn logic stays unit-testable; the
 * I/O (member lookup, session spawn, event subscription) lives in the
 * dispatcher / daemon and calls into these predicates.
