/**
 * A containment handle: the thing that still identifies a mojo turn's process
 * subtree AFTER the backend object that spawned it is gone.
 *
 * Why this module exists
 * ---------------------
 * mojo-process-tree.ts can enumerate a subtree, but only while someone still
 * remembers two facts: the root pid, and the env nonce that was injected into it.
 * Both used to live in per-instance MojoBackend fields (`lastTurnPid`, a
 * `readonly treeNonce` freshly randomised in the field initialiser). Every worker
 * generation therefore got a BRAND NEW nonce and a null root pid, which means a
 * subtree left behind by the previous generation became permanently
 * unenumerable — and `terminateChildProven()` reads "no root pid" as "no subtree
 * exists" and returns true. A credentialed survivor thus turned into a
 * successful close, the row was published `closed`, and the device-isolation
 * blocker vanished (mergePersistedDeviceIsolationSessions filters closed rows).
 *
 * So the handle has to outlive the backend, the worker generation and the daemon
 * process. That is what this module provides, plus the ONE rule that makes it
 * safe:
 *
 *   a handle may only be released when quiescence is PROVEN.
 *
 * Two strengths of handle
 * -----------------------
 *   STRONG (`cgroup`) — a per-session cgroup v2 directory. Membership survives
 *     setsid and is the right tool to KILL a whole turn subtree (cgroup.kill) and
 *     to ENUMERATE it. But `cgroup.procs` being empty is NOT a boundary proof:
 *     mojo runs at the daemon's UID, and cgroup v2 lets a same-UID process migrate
 *     ITSELF out of the leaf (to the parent slice or a sibling) within the
 *     delegation domain — a move the leaf-down read cannot see. So a cgroup handle
 *     is treated like a weak one for RELEASE purposes (emptiness stops signalling
 *     and lets the row close, but the blocker is retained); only a per-session UID
 *     or namespace the process cannot leave would make emptiness a real proof.
 *
 *   WEAK (`tree-identity`) — a persisted (rootPid, bootId, startTime, nonce)
 *     record for hosts with no usable cgroup v2 (this includes cgroup-v1-only
 *     hosts and Darwin). It is EVIDENCE THAT A TREE MAY STILL EXIST, never proof
 *     that one is gone. `bootId` + `startTime` exist so that pid REUSE cannot be
 *     mistaken for the original tree (and, in the one genuinely provable
 *     direction, so that a reboot can be recognised as having killed it).
 *
 * Fail-closed, in the same direction as the rest of the isolation path
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Unreadable state, an unsupported platform, a timeout, or any "cannot tell"
 * answer resolves to NOT PROVEN, so the caller keeps the blocker. This matches
 * the scanner's fail-closed contract (a read error fails the whole scan) and the
 * destroy contract's `local-unproven` staying fenced. `mojo-launcher-env-quarantine`
 * deliberately shipped with no clearing API because "proving that needs
 * trustworthy termination of the whole mojo process group ... which does not
 * exist yet"; `proveContainmentQuiescent` is that missing mechanism, which is why
 * releasing is allowed here and only against a proven verdict.

 * process runs on in the nested group. Reading the whole subtree closes that

 * NOTE ON SCOPE: this proves quiescence of the subtree we OWN. It does not, and

 *   'running'    — any other state. Treated as executing.
 *   'gone'       — ENOENT: the pid vanished between listing and reading, i.e.
 *                  genuinely not a member any more (same race rule the scanner
 *                  applies).

 *
 * DUPLICATED RULE — read before changing any of the three cases
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * The same zombie rule has to hold in TWO places that deliberately do not share
 * code: here, for cgroup members read out of `cgroup.procs`, and in the /proc
 * subtree scanner (mojo-process-tree), for members found by enumeration. They stay
 * separate because they start from different inputs, but they must agree, and
 * nothing enforces that agreement automatically.
 *
 * Why the agreement matters more than the rule itself: if one side discounts a
 * zombie and the other does not, the SAME tree gets two verdicts. That is not a
 * cosmetic inconsistency — ProcTree hit it for real while wiring 7-A. A SIGKILLed
 * child sat in state Z awaiting reap; the in-memory ladder discounted it and
 * reported clean, while the pid list handed to `proveContainmentQuiescent` still
 * carried it, so this module judged the tree alive. The close was then refused
 * forever and the handle could never be discharged: a permanent wedge produced
 * purely by two definitions of "running".
 *
 * So: change one side and you MUST change the other. The rule is exactly
 *   - state 'Z'        -> discounted (a zombie executes nothing, holds no credential)
 *   - ENOENT           -> gone, skipped (raced away; not a member)
 *   - anything else     -> EXECUTING, including any state we cannot read
 * The last case is the one that must never be relaxed on either side: turning an
 * unreadable state into "harmless" is a fail-open, and it is reachable by the very
 * process being policed.

 * on a plain Linux host it can be nothing more than "the scan saw nobody", and
 * those two must not share a code path.
 *
 * Truth table, all of it pinned by unit tests:
 *
 *   verdict           evidence              boundaryProof  release  residual
 *   ----------------  --------------------  -------------  -------  --------
 *   proven, weak      boot-id-changed       true           yes      null
 *   proven, cgroup    boot-id-changed       true           yes      null
 *   proven, cgroup    cgroup-empty          FALSE          NO       deviceIsolation
 *   proven, cgroup    cgroup-zombie-only    FALSE          NO       deviceIsolation
 *   proven, weak      scan-clean            FALSE          NO       deviceIsolation

 *
 * Only a reboot (boot-id-changed) authorises forgetting a tree — for BOTH handle
 * kinds since the strong handle gained a stamped bootId (a reboot kills the
 * whole tree, sibling-migrant included, and resets cgroupfs). A cgroup being
 * empty is NOT a boundary proof — a same-UID process can migrate itself out of
 * the leaf, invisible to the leaf-down read — so an emptiness verdict behaves
 * exactly like a weak scan-clean: it lets the caller stop re-signalling
 * (`signalsStopped: true`) and lets the SESSION close, but authorises nothing
 * else. The handle stays in the durable store, so `hasUnprovenContainment` keeps
 * answering true and the device-isolation blocker survives the close.

 * meeting here:

 *   - `quiescenceFromScan()` can never produce `boundaryProof: true`; a clean
 *     /proc scan is a diagnostic signal, because a descendant that both setsids
 *     AND scrubs its own environ evades enumeration entirely.
 *   - An empty (or zombie-only) `cgroup.procs` is ALSO only a diagnostic signal,
 *     NOT a boundary proof: mojo runs at the daemon's UID and cgroup v2 lets a
 *     same-UID process migrate itself out of the leaf, invisible to the leaf-down
 *     read. cgroup emptiness is good for stopping signals and for killing
 *     (cgroup.kill), never for dropping device isolation.
 *   - `boot-id-changed` is the only unforgeable release: a reboot kills the whole
 *     tree, migrant included. It applies to a weak handle and to a cgroup handle
 *     once its bootId is stamped.
 *
 * So a STRONG (cgroup) proven-empty verdict maps to `diagnostic-clean`, exactly
 * like a weak `scan-clean`, and `containmentReleaseDecision` refuses to authorise
