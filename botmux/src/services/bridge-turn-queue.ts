/**
 * Adopt-bridge turn attribution state machine.
 *
 * Pure (no fs / IPC / timers) so the worker can wrap it with watchers and
 * tests can drive it deterministically. The worker feeds it transcript
 * events (already drained from JSONL) and Lark-message markers; this class
 * decides which assistant uuids belong to which Lark turn.
 *
 * Attribution rule:
 *   - mark()           — pushes a new pending turn entry (state: not started)
 *   - ingest(events)   — for each new user/assistant event:
 *       * user event → the earliest unstarted pending turn whose fingerprint
 *         matches becomes 'started' (its assistantUuids will collect from
 *         now on). A user event that does NOT match any pending fingerprint
 *         (or arrives with no pending Lark turn at all) is treated as
 *         **local terminal input**: a synthetic local turn is created on
 *         the spot, started immediately, and inserted ahead of any
 *         still-unstarted Lark turns so emit ordering reflects when the
 *         user event actually landed in the transcript. The local turn is
 *         emitted with `isLocal: true` so the worker can format it with a
 *         "user typed in the terminal" marker for the Lark thread.
 *       * assistant text event (non-sidechain) → appended to the
 *         currently-collecting turn (Lark or local), if any.
 *   - drainEmittable() — pops any leading turn that has been started AND has
 *     accumulated at least one visible assistant-text uuid. Started turns with no text
 *     yet (Claude is mid-tool-use) stay queued for the next idle.
 *
 * Baseline (`absorb()`) takes a batch of historical events and registers
 * their uuids as already-seen so future ingest doesn't double-attribute.
