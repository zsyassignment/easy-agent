/**
 * Codex bridge fallback's pending-turn queue.
 *
 * Two operating modes via `setLocalTurns()`:
 *
 *   - **non-adopt** (default): worker owns the PTY and the only legitimate
 *     user input source is Lark. user_message events that don't match a
 *     pending fingerprint are history (resume / late-attach) and get
 *     silently dropped. Synthesising local turns here would replay
 *     yesterday's prompts to the Lark thread.
 *
 *   - **adopt**: Codex is the user's externally-running process; the user
 *     can type directly into the iTerm pane (or via Lark). Both should
 *     reach the Lark thread. user_message events that don't match a
 *     pending Lark fingerprint AND happen after `localLowerBoundMs - 5s`
 *     synthesise a local turn — formatted by the worker as
 *     "🖥️ 终端本地对话".
 *
 * Attribution rule:
 *   - mark()           — push a pending turn anchored to Lark fingerprint.
 *   - ingest(events)   —
 *       * 'user' event: first classify it — does it START the head pending
 *         turn (fingerprint match, not tooOld) or SYNTHESISE a local turn
 *         (adopt-only)? Only a 'user' event that does one of those triggers
 *         HOL-block-drop: if a turn is still collecting with no finalText,
 *         discard it. Codex 0.134.0 type-ahead is an active-turn STEER: a
 *         queued message typed while a tool-running turn is in flight gets
 *         pulled into that SAME turn, which emits one merged final (rollout:
 *         user1 → user2 → assistant_final). The earlier turn never gets its
 *         own final, so without this drop it sits at the queue head forever
 *         and wedges drainEmittable(). A 'user' event that neither matches a
 *         fingerprint nor synthesises a local turn (e.g. the startup
 *         <environment_context>, or replayed history) is IGNORED and does NOT
 *         drop the collecting turn — keying HOL-drop off the turn-start
 *         decision reuses its tooOld/fingerprint freshness as one invariant.
 *       * terminal event → the currently-collecting turn closes with
 *         finalText set; an abort uses empty text plus an ambiguous terminal
 *         outcome so durable delivery settles without inventing a reply.
 *   - drainEmittable() — pop FIFO any leading turn that is started AND has
 *     reached either terminal edge.
