 *  against pi 0.84.2: `terminate:true` is still not persisted and the newer
 *  pending/deferred StopReasons never reach the session JSONL), so a started
 *  Pi turn may suppress the screen-ready heuristic. OMP additionally retains
 *  terminal records provisionally until a decisive record or guarded quiet
 *  tick proves no plugin continuation follows. Accepted gap: a custom
 *  tool returning `terminate:true` leaves a started turn with no on-disk
 *  terminal — the card stays working until the NEXT user turn's transcript
 *  user event HOL-drops the unclosed head (botmux ships no such tool; same
 *  bounded-recovery shape Codex accepts for lost rollout finals). ebsd does
 *  not use that provisional OMP stop: it commits a versioned custom terminal
 *  only after its hidden diagnosis finalizer has completed. Grok's
 *  updates.jsonl exposes an authoritative user_message_chunk → turn_completed
 *  lifecycle; the parser maps end_turn, cancelled, error, and unknown stop
 *  reasons to explicit terminal outcomes, while worker exit owns the remaining
 *  ambiguous boundary. Keep a transient TUI prompt from publishing idle until
 *  that structured terminal settles the turn. Other structured drivers still
 *  use the queue for attribution, but their interrupted/error shapes are not
 *  yet complete enough to let a started turn suppress screen-ready forever. */
