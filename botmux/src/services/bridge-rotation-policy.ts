 *     fingerprint fallback) already moved the watcher this tick.
 *
 * Returns true only when there was no earlier switch AND the pid resolver
 * gave no opinion.
 *
 * Trade-off: pid resolver `'same'` is NOT proof that no rotation happened
 * — Claude Code 2.1.123 writes `sessionId` ONCE at process start and the
 * in-pane `/clear` path does not refresh it. We still skip the mtime
 * heuristic on `'same'` because the alternative is sibling-pane hijack:
 * any other Claude pane in the same cwd gets a busier jsonl and the
 * heuristic picks it. The cost is that a pure-local `/clear` with no
 * pending Lark turn won't auto-follow until the user sends a Lark
 * message (which arms fingerprint fallback). The Lark-message path is
 * the dominant /clear recovery flow in practice; sibling-pane
 * corruption would silently break every multi-pane adopt setup.
 *
 * `--resume` is a fresh spawn and rewrites the pid file's sessionId, so
 * it surfaces here as `'switched'`, not `'same'` — it's not affected by
 * this gate.

 *   - 0 matches → no-match
 *   - 1 match  → switch (the post-/clear file we couldn't otherwise see)

 * worker pins `bridgeJsonlPath` to `<sessionId>.jsonl` and waits for that
 * file to appear before baselining. If Claude wrote its transcript under a
 * DIFFERENT sessionId than the one we guessed — `--session-id` not honoured,
 * a stale resume id, or an /adopt sid persisted as the botmux sid — the
 * guessed file never appears, `baselineDone` stays false forever, and every
 * turn is dropped ("baseline not ready"). The bridge is then permanently
 * stuck on a path that does not exist (the user-reported "message went into
 * the PTY but final_output was never attributed" symptom). The pid-state
 * resolver that would normally correct this needs a live CLI pid, which is
 * often missing on restart-restore — so the only recovery path that still
 * works is the exact-content fingerprint scan, and IT is starved because no
 * turn is ever marked.
 *
 * An ABSENT file has no prior history to absorb, so it is safe to declare
 * fresh-empty readiness (offset 0, baseline done) here: the pending turn
 * then gets marked, which arms the per-tick exact-content fingerprint
 * recovery (`decideFingerprintSwitch`) to discover the jsonl Claude actually
 * appended this message to and switch the bridge onto it — no dependence on
 * Claude's internal pid-state / tasks files, so it is Claude-version-robust.
 *
 * Returns true ONLY when baseline isn't done, a path is pinned, and that
 * path is absent. When the file EXISTS (the genuine slow-resume-with-history
 * case), this returns false so normal lazy-baseline runs instead and prior
