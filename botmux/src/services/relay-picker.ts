/**
 * Shared helper for collecting the operator's relayable sessions used by the
 * /relay picker. Same selection criteria used both at first render
 * (command-handler) and on each card-update click (card-handler re-render),
 * so factor it out to keep both paths in sync.
 *
 * Selection rules:
 *   • same bot (this larkAppId — only this daemon's sessions are visible)
 *   • NOT in the current chat (can't relay into the chat it already lives in)
 *   • operator is the session owner (owner-only access) — ownerless
 *     sessions (ownerOpenId unset, e.g. alert-listener spawned) are
 *     visible to every operator, matching the relay_confirm / /relay
 *     --create owner gates
 *   • not an adopt session (those wrap a user-attached tmux pane, refused
 *     by transferSession anyway)
 *
 * Resolves friendly chat names and modes via getChatNameAndMode in parallel
 * (1 API call per unique source chatId). Failure modes are tolerant:
 * unresolved chats fall back to the raw chatId for chatLabel and the
 * session's own chatType for mode.
