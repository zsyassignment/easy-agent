// stays with systemd/launchd, which run `botmux start` → this supervisor.
//
// Same boot hygiene as index-daemon: scrub any session-scoped env a parent may
// have leaked, so children don't inherit a stale identity.

// via index-dashboard.ts), and resolveFleetDaemonEnv() below spreads this
// process's env into every supervised member, so an unstripped secret would
// sit in this long-lived process for its whole life and ride into every bot
// daemon (which then strips it again at its own boot).
//
// This also cuts the ambient-env inheritance path into the dashboard
// (supervisor is its parent; daemon is not). That's intentional: aligned
// with the long-standing scrubPm2CallerEnv convention on the pm2 path; the
// supervisor form never had this boundary before. The documented channel
// remains ~/.botmux/.env — the dashboard loads that file itself.

// child's starting env for the supervisor's whole lifetime. Match
// index-daemon.ts's boot scrub exactly (rather than a hand-picked subset of
