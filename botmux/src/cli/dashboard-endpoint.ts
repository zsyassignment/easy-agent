/**
 * Loopback HMAC client for the dashboard process's `/__cli/*` endpoints, used by
 * `botmux dashboard [current|rotate]` and the post-start/restart hint.
 *
 * Two subtleties this module exists to handle correctly:
 *
 * 1. **404 is ambiguous.** Only the dashboard's `/__cli/current` returns 404 to
 *    mean "no token minted yet" (`{ error: 'no_active_token' }`). Any *other*
 *    404 means the request hit a server that doesn't speak the `/__cli`
 *    protocol — most commonly the daemon IPC server, whose unknown-route 404 is
 *    `{ error: 'not_found', path }`. Conflating the two surfaces the infamous
 *    misleading `Rotation failed: no-active-token` when the real problem is that
 *    `.dashboard-port` points at the wrong service.
 *
 * 2. **`.dashboard-port` can go stale.** The dashboard (wildcard) and the daemon
 *    IPC servers (loopback) both `listenWithProbe` upward. Their base ports are
 *    now kept disjoint (config.dashboard.port 7891 + probe span vs ipcBasePort
 *    7950 — see config.ts, guarded by dashboard-ipc-port-range.test.ts), so a
 *    recorded dashboard port should no longer end up owned by an IPC server. The
 *    HMAC self-heal below stays as defense-in-depth: when the recorded port
 *    answers as the *wrong service* (e.g. a foreign squatter pushed the dashboard
 *    onto an unexpected port), we rediscover the real dashboard by HMAC-probing
 *    the probe range (only the genuine dashboard can validate the signature) and
 *    self-heal `.dashboard-port`.
