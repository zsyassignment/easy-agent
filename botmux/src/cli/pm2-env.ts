 * Scrub the env handed to a pm2 invocation, in place.
 *
 * pm2 persists the CALLER's environment into every managed app it starts or
 * restarts — and into dump.pm2, which `pm2 resurrect` replays after a reboot,
 * bypassing this function entirely. So anything left here is not just handed to
 * the fleet, it is written to disk under ~/.botmux/pm2 and readable from
 * `pm2 describe` / `pm2 jlist` output for as long as that dump survives.
 *
 * Extracted from cli.ts's pm2Env() so the resulting env is assertable in a test
 * (cli.ts is a multi-thousand-line command module with top-level side effects).
