# Multi-CLI Adapters

botmux bridges different CLIs / agents through adapters, selected via `cliId` in `bots.json` — one-click switching. **Local adapters each run as their own process** (under the default tmux backend you can `tmux attach` into the real process; explicit pty/zellij/herdr backends differ); a few are integrated over API / remotely (e.g. Mira, riff) and are not local processes.

**Applies to**: when you want to switch the underlying CLI, or wire up a new tool, and need its `cliId` and whether it takes a `model` param.
**Doesn't apply**: strict Codex-compatible distributions and wrappers / gateways (ccr, aiden x claude, …) do not need new adapters — see [Codex-compatible distributions](#codex-compatible-distributions) and [Wrapper / gateway integration](#wrapper--gateway-integration) below.

## Supported CLIs / Agents

The table lists the current built-in adapters (the **authoritative source** for `cliId`s is [`src/adapters/cli/registry.ts`](https://github.com/deepcoldy/botmux/blob/master/src/adapters/cli/registry.ts), which changes across versions):

> The `model` field only takes effect for adapters that support a model parameter; others ignore it. Mir CLI's extra prerequisites (login / miramcp) are in the section below.

## DeepSeek Harness (dsh)

`cliId: "dsh"` drives a local `dsh` CLI (the [deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseekai/deepseek-harness)) through the bundled runner via `dsh --profile <name>` over the SDK JSON-RPC protocol. Prerequisites:

1. `dsh` on PATH (or point `cliPathOverride` at it). **Upgrade note**: this is the `dsh` command from the npm package `@deepseek-ai/dsh`. Earlier versions relied on `dsh-jsonrpc-agent` from the Python wheel — if only that older command is on PATH, the adapter will fail with "command not found" after upgrading.
2. Native `dsh` CLI configured (`$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` + `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`; defaults to `~/.dsh/...` when `DSH_HOME` is unset).
3. The target profile (default `botmux`, overridable per bot via `dshProfile`) lives under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>/` (default `~/.dsh/profiles/<name>/`). **No manual setup is needed for first use**: when the profile is absent, botmux writes the skeleton (`package.json` + empty `cordis.yml` + `cordis.patch.yml`) and runs `dsh plugin add` to install its dependencies. To add community plugins or switch LLM providers, edit that profile's `cordis.patch.yml` — botmux only creates these files when missing and never overwrites existing content. Configure `DSH_HOME` only on the daemon process; per-bot `env.DSH_HOME` is reserved/rejected so the adapter's prepared paths cannot diverge from the child runtime.

The runner reads `agent-default-model` (provider + model) from `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` for the initialize RPC; the plugin composition is entirely controlled by the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` — the runner no longer generates cordis.yml.

When editing `cordis.patch.yml`, note that the two entry forms mean different things: `- insert: [...]` **inserts** new plugins, while a bare `- id: X` (no `insert`) **overrides the config of an existing** plugin and is silently skipped when that id is not present. The default patch botmux generates inserts only `sdk-jsonrpc-server` (the one plugin `dsh-base` lacks), inherits everything else from `dsh-base`, and disables the Web GUI plugins that would block startup in headless mode.

Session JSONL lives under `$DSH_HOME/sessions/botmux/` (default `~/.dsh/sessions/botmux/`). Turns are multi-turn within one runner connection; a daemon restart starts a fresh session (no context resume). The TUI runtime (`dshRuntime: "tui"`) still keeps its own UI state under `~/.dsh-tui`.

`ask_user_question` is bridged through a temporary DSH profile patch generated by botmux. The official runner injects the bridge directly; `dshRuntime: "tui"` uses a dsh-tui wrapper patch that wraps the native question provider, asks in Lark first, and falls back to the native TUI for unsupported prompts. Set `BOTMUX_DSH_ASK_BRIDGE=0` and restart the session to disable the bridge.

## Mir CLI and MCP Bridge

When you choose **Mira -> Mir CLI (local mircli)** in `botmux setup`, the bot is configured with `cliId: "mir"`. This adapter runs the local `mircli -p --lean`, so the same system user that runs the botmux daemon must already have Mir CLI authenticated and initialized.

BotMux does not need any DevBox-specific configuration. The same rules apply on DevBox, local macOS, or other Linux machines:

- `mircli` can be found by botmux, or the bot config points `cliPathOverride` at the absolute `mircli` path.
- `~/.mira/config.json` already contains a `device_id`. This is usually written by `mircli mcp --device-id <id>` or Mir CLI's own initialization flow.
- `miramcp` is installed in a standard Mir CLI location such as `~/.local/bin/miramcp` or `~/.local/bin/mira_cli`, or `MIRAMCP_BIN` points at the executable.

When a `cliId: "mir"` session starts and receives a message, BotMux best-effort starts the MCP Bridge before invoking `mircli`:

```bash
miramcp run --device-id <device_id>
```

It first checks `~/.mira/miramcp/miramcp.pid` and local port `9801`, so an already-running bridge is reused instead of started twice. To inspect the bridge, run this as the same user that runs the botmux daemon:

```bash
mircli mcp status
```

To disable this autostart behavior, either set this in `~/.mira/config.json`:

```json
{"auto_start_bridge": false}
```

or disable it only for BotMux:

```bash
MIRCLI_AUTO_START_MIRAMCP=0 botmux start
```

## Codex-compatible distributions

BotMux separates protocol capability from distribution identity: `cliId: "codex"` selects the Codex protocol adapter, while `cliRuntime` selects the independently released executable that actually runs. A compatible fork can therefore reuse model arguments, resume, idle detection, and gated RPC without being checked against the official Codex version stream.

Use `cliRuntime` only for a **strictly compatible fork**: it must accept the arguments BotMux sends to Codex, preserve the same interaction state and rollout / resume semantics, and use a compatible authentication / home layout. If it changes arguments, the TUI state machine, session storage, or protocol, it needs a real adapter instead of a compatibility declaration.

See the [`bots.json` Codex-compatible distributions section](/en/bots-json#codex-compatible-distributions) for the complete config and update-provider behavior. The Dashboard Bot Defaults page can also configure and preflight a runtime. Existing `cliPathOverride` configs remain supported, but do not automatically enable Codex RPC features that require an explicit compatibility declaration.

## Wrapper / gateway integration

In many cases you don't run the native CLI directly but wrap it with a gateway / router (internal proxy + SSO, model routing, etc.), such as `ccr`, `ttadk`, `aiden x claude`, `aiden x codex`. In this case you **don't need a new adapter**: `cliId` still holds the real underlying CLI (`claude-code` / `codex` …), and you only swap the launch entry point for a **wrapper script**, pointing to it with `cliPathOverride` (the "CLI executable path override" when editing a bot in `botmux setup` is exactly this).

**Four general steps:**

1. **Log in to the gateway first** (one-time): complete the SSO login as the **same system user** that runs the daemon; the token is cached in that user's home directory. An expired token will pop an interactive login that blocks the PTY, so keep the login state alive.
2. **Write the wrapper script** in `~/.botmux/bin/`, passing the arguments botmux injects through to the real CLI (note: some gateways reject the `--settings` botmux injects, so strip it in the script).
3. **`chmod +x` to add the executable bit (the easiest one to miss!)** — botmux uses node-pty to exec the script directly; without the executable bit you get `EACCES`, the CLI exits immediately on launch, and the bot crashes and restarts.
4. **Verify by executing the script directly** (use `~/.botmux/bin/xxx --version`, don't test with `bash xxx` — running via bash doesn't need the executable bit and will mask the problem in step 3). Then configure `cliPathOverride` in `bots.json` (use an **absolute path**, not `~`), and run `botmux restart` to take effect.

For the **specific wrapper scripts** of each gateway, use the docs published by the corresponding CLI / gateway team. This public repository intentionally does not include internal document links or copied internal content.

- **aiden × claude / aiden × codex** — aiden×codex needs `script` to force a PTY
- **ttadk** — pay attention to wrapper argument forwarding and login state
- **MTR** — community-contributed, `npm i -g @metamove-code/mtr-cli@latest`
>
> A general technique for troubleshooting wrapper issues: run `botmux logs`, find the `Spawning fresh CLI:` line, copy the full command, and run it manually locally to pinpoint the problem (permissions / argument blacklist / login state).

## Adding a new adapter (contributors)
