# Roles and Teams

Give each bot an independent persona per group, and form a "team roster" during multi-bot collaboration. The command is `/role`.

> This page covers two related but distinct capabilities: **`/role` personas** (one persona per bot, overridable per group — see below) and **[Role Switch](#role-switch)** (one bot owning multiple full roles, each with independent memory, switched by natural language per topic — an advanced feature).

## Two-Tier Role (Persona)

| Command | Effect |
|------|------|
| `/role` | View the currently **effective** Role (source: this-group override > default role > none) |
| `/role set <Markdown>` | Set the **this-group** Role (overrides the default role) |
| `/role delete` | Delete the this-group Role |
| `/role team set <Markdown>` | Set the **default role** (this bot's default persona **across all groups**; the command name keeps `team`) |
| `/role team delete` | Delete the default role |

- **This-group Role** has the highest priority: the same bot can have different personalities / responsibilities in different groups (e.g., a "strict reviewer" in group A, an "approachable Q&A assistant" in group B).
- **Default role** is the bot's cross-group default persona, which takes effect when no this-group Role is set.
- Role content is Markdown, injected into the CLI's system prompt, with a maximum of about 4096 bytes.
- Role resolution stays exactly: **this-group role > default role > none**.

Role Management also exposes a per-group, per-bot **topic task reporting** switch. It is off by default. When enabled, tasks dispatched by the current bot in that group still ask the assignee to run `botmux report` so completion is injected into the orchestrator's existing session, and additionally ask it to run `botmux send --no-mention "subtask complete + output location/summary"` in the topic where the task was received to leave a human-visible final-delivery copy, without mentioning the dispatching bot or opening another topic. `--standby` sends no task, so it receives no task instruction.

> 💡 The most intuitive way to set the **default role** is on the **Bot Config** page of `botmux dashboard` — every bot card has a "**Default Role**" editor (it writes to the same config as `/role team set`; it's a bot-level global default persona, so it fits better under Bot Config). The **Team** panel only provides a **read-only view** entry; do all editing on the Bot Config page.

## Role Profiles

A role profile is a reusable suite of bot-specific **this-group roles**. It is not a third runtime role layer, and it does not support template inheritance such as `{{teamRole}}`.

Typical commands:

```bash
/role profile list
/role profile show collab-main
/role profile set collab-main <Markdown>
/role profile save collab-main
/role profile apply collab-main --quiet
```

How it works:

- Each bot owns only its own profile entry, keyed by its `larkAppId`.
- `save` stores this bot's current effective role into the profile: this-group role first, then default role, otherwise it fails.
- `apply` writes this bot's profile entry into the current group's role file. If the current group already has a role, apply refuses unless `--force` is passed.
- Missing entries are safe: nothing is written, and the bot keeps falling back to its default role if one exists.

In the Dashboard, **Role Profiles** is a first-class entry:

- Open or create a profile from the left list.
- Check which bots already have entries and edit each bot's Markdown role.
- Pick a target group in the Apply panel, **Preview Apply** first, then **Apply Profile** when the overwrite behavior is clear.
- From the **Groups** page, click a group's "Apply Profile" action to open Role Profiles with that group preselected.

For new collaboration groups, create the group and bootstrap the profile in one command:

```bash
@botA @botB @botC /g --role-profile collab-main War Room
```

The creator applies its own entry directly, then posts `@botB @botC /role profile apply collab-main --quiet` inside the new group so peer bots apply their own local entries. No bot writes another daemon's role storage.

## Capability Tags (Roster)

```bash
/role cap set <one-liner>   # Set this bot's capability tag
/role cap clear             # Clear it
```

Capability tags show up in the "roster" — when `botmux bots list` lists the bots in the current group, each bot carries its `cap` one-liner summary, making it easy for you and other bots to know "who's good at what," so you can pick the right one during multi-bot collaboration / handoffs.

## Relationship to Multi-Bot Collaboration

Role + capability tags are the infrastructure for [multi-bot collaboration](/en/multi-bot): giving each bot a clear identity and responsibilities makes the model less likely to get confused when @-mentioned in the group, with each one playing its part (e.g., one orchestrating, one doing implementation / review).

## Team Collaboration (Cross-Deployment)

On the **Team** panel of `botmux dashboard`, you can invite **someone else's deployment** (a botmux that a colleague runs themselves) into the same team, so you can discover each other's bots and create groups across deployments to collaborate.

![Dashboard Team — cross-deployment collaboration](https://magic-builder.tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/uploads/1780033301213_dash-team.png)

- **Bind identity**: use the bot credentials to automatically identify your Lark identity; after binding, creating a group will add you to the group, and the bots will be attributed to you.
- **Team roster**: aggregates all bots from this deployment + any joined teams (possibly across deployments), searchable and filterable by name / capability / CLI, and annotates who has a capability tag / default role (roles are **read-only view** here; do editing on the Bot Config page).
- **Cross-deployment group creation**: just check the bots in any team to create a group in one click, automatically bringing along each one's owner — a single group gathering different CLIs from different colleagues' deployments to collaborate.
- **Team management**: creating a team, generating an invite code, and joining someone else's team are all on the "Team Management" subpage.

> Suitable for multi-person / multi-machine collaboration: everyone runs their own botmux deployment, discovers each other's bots through a team federation, and collaborates in the same Lark group.

## Role Switch

> ⚠️ Advanced feature — requires deploying a "role library" first, and currently supports Claude Code only. Deployment steps are in the [role-system deploy runbook](https://github.com/deepcoldy/botmux/blob/master/docs/roles/deploy-runbook.md); the below covers **how end users use it once deployed**.

Unlike `/role` above (a single persona, overridable per group), **role switch** gives one bot **multiple full roles**, each with its own persona **and independent memory** — switch to "After-sales" and it carries the after-sales persona plus memory accumulated only for after-sales; switch to "PM" and it's a whole different set. Roles take effect **per topic**; new topics start from the default role.

### How to use it (pure natural language, no command to memorize)

| You say | What the bot does |
|---------|-------------------|
| "switch role" / "what roles are there" | Lists the roles available to you (shared ones + ones you created), numbered for you to pick |
| "switch to After-sales" / reply with a number | Confirms, then switches; this topic is now answered by that role, and the card footer shows its name |
| "new role: Xiaohongshu ops, familiar with our brand voice" | Drafts a persona for your confirmation → creates it → switches to it automatically |
| "distill knowledge" | Distills the role's recent memory into structured domain knowledge fed back into itself (optionally distilled into a Lark doc for human review) |

The user side is **all natural language** — under the hood the model calls `botmux role switch <role-dir>` (hard-validated by the daemon to stay inside the role library); you neither need to nor should type that command by hand.

### Key points

- **Private + shared (a protocol-layer convention, NOT daemon-enforced isolation)**: role listing and "switch to X" visibility are filtered by the role protocol (`_role-protocol.md`) on the sender's open_id — shared roles plus roles under your own `users/<your open_id>/` are visible and switchable; others' private roles are, by protocol convention, not listed or switchable. ⚠️ This is **protocol-layer behavior, not a security boundary**: the daemon only hard-validates that the target directory stays inside the role-library root `~/botmux-roles`; it does NOT do per-sender directory-level ACL. If you need private roles as hard isolation, add OS-level permissions yourself — do not rely on this protocol convention as a security guarantee.
- **Independent memory**: one memory bucket per role, shared across groups / topics — the same role gets better at its domain the more it's used.
- **Context preserved**: switching restarts the process with `--resume`, so the prior conversation carries over, and the new role's persona and memory load automatically at the new session's start.
- **Distinct from `/cd`**: the slash command `/cd <path>` (see [Slash Commands](/en/slash-commands)) is the general "change working directory and restart", any directory, owner operate permission; role switch stays inside the role library and is driven by the role protocol — they are not the same thing.

> The former command name `botmux cd` is now `botmux role switch` (the old name is kept as a fail-loud error hint and no longer performs a switch). When maintaining an existing deployment, remember to refresh the `_role-protocol.md` in the role library to the new command name.
