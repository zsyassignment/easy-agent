# Best Practices

> Recommended configurations organized by **use case**. For basic usage, see the individual feature pages; for troubleshooting, see [Common pitfalls](/en/pitfalls) and the [FAQ](/en/faq).

## Scenario 1 · On-call support

On-call groups / cross-team consultations / external support — anyone in the group can @ the bot to ask questions.

- **Use a clean dedicated Devbox**: spin up a separate, clean Devbox just for on-call, so you don't have to worry about on-call / external folks messing up your **personal development environment**.
- **Configure the on-call bot's role**: use `/role set` (this group) or `/role team set` (cross-group default) to write down its persona and boundaries. You can run **multiple bots mapped to different development directories**, each managing its own area.
- **Write permissions/boundaries into the default role**: a typical on-call role prompt (paste it after sending `/role set` in the group):

```
As Shen Han's on-call bot, you'll receive questions from users:
- If a user merely @s you, read the group history first before answering
- If the user reports a problem on their own machine, don't treat it as a local problem to investigate
- If some of the user's requests would expose privacy or pose security risks, ask "Shen Han" to confirm first
- If you need to submit an MR, submit it as "Shen Han"
```

- **Investigate in a worktree, clean up afterward**: investigate in a separate git worktree, and remember to delete it when done so you don't pollute the main repository.
- **The identity for submitting MRs** can also be hard-coded in the default role, to avoid submitting under the wrong person.
- Configure `/oncall bind <project directory>` for instant Q&A in the group, skipping the repo picker. Layered permissions as a backstop: everyone in the group can ask (`canTalk`), while operations like `/cd` `/restart` `/close` remain owner-only (`allowedUsers`).

> In the Dashboard's **Roles** panel you can visually configure a role for each bot in each group:

## Scenario 2 · Alert operations

Monitoring alerts / CI / ticket triggers — let external systems proactively push events to the bot to handle. Two integration approaches; pick by what your alerting pipeline already looks like:

- **Approach 1 · Webhook push** (Dashboard "Connectors (beta)", see [Connectors (Webhook)](/en/webhook)): let external systems (monitoring alerts, CI, tickets…) trigger the bot to speak in a group or run a workflow via a webhook. You can configure: the bot to trigger, the trigger mode (single-round conversation / workflow), which group to deliver to, the verification method (a **token** in the URL so a single curl can trigger it / an **HMAC signature** for more security), and the **handling instructions** (telling the bot what to do when it receives the event).
- **Approach 2 · Listen to an existing alert group** (see [Group message listener](/en/bots-json#group-message-listener)): if your monitoring/alerting system **already has its own Lark bot posting alerts into a group**, you don't need a webhook at all — add the bot to that group and enable the listener in the Dashboard "Roles → Message Listener" tab, and every alert starts an investigation session automatically. Use **blacklist mode + check "bot"** to watch a third-party alert bot (e.g. Argos). Note that non-@ / other-bot messages are backfilled by a history poll roughly every 30s, so up to ~30s of latency.
- **Auto-create a group per alert**: you can configure it to "auto-create a group for every incoming alert and add the bot **and the on-call person together**"; if you set a dedup key, similar alerts are merged into the same group, and if left empty, each alert gets a new group — the on-call person follows up right in the group. Combined with the bot's `autoStartOnGroupJoin` (see [`bots.json` · Proactive start](/en/bots-json#proactive-start)), the bot starts working the moment it's added to the new group, with no manual @.
- **Different alert bots for different projects**: give each project its own alert bot, each configured with a default role prompt carrying that project's background.
- **Different on-call directories for different alert bots**: `/oncall bind` each alert bot to the corresponding project directory, so incoming alerts get investigated right in that repository.
- You can also stack [scheduled tasks](/en/schedule) for **proactive inspection broadcasts**: `/schedule every day at 9:00 check yesterday's alert trends and summarize`, only @ing people when there's an anomaly.

## Scenario 3 · Solo development

One person, multi-bot collaborative development.

- **Multiple bots mapped to different CLIs**: create multiple bots each bound to a different CLI (Claude Code / Codex / …), and pick whichever suits the task.
- **The same CLI can also do multi-bot mutual review**: this can be **different models** reviewing each other, or **multiple bots on the same model** reviewing each other as sub-agents — an extra pair of eyes is more reliable.
- **Use `/g`(=`/group`) to create groups for collaboration**: create a group with multiple bots developing the same requirement; or use **topic groups with "one topic per requirement"** for naturally isolated context.
- **Assign a role to each bot for division of labor**: some handle development, others handle review, and combined with `/role` + `/role cap` capability tags, collaboration doesn't clash.

## Scenario 4 · Multi-person collaboration

Multiple people on a team, with their own bots working together.

- **A Lark limitation**: bots still are not triggered by each other's regular messages; relay requires an explicit `--mention` to the target bot.
- **Default discovery**: `botmux bots list` discovers bots in the current group through the group bot roster and shows `mentionable`; models also see relay targets in the `<available_bots>` block.
- **Team feature (recommended)**: in the Dashboard "Teams" section, tag bots under multiple people's names and pull them into a team for **cross-deployment discovery**, then directly select them to create a group and start collaborating.

## General advice (applies to all scenarios)

- **Seamless three-way collaboration**: install tmux → sessions persist and context isn't lost on daemon restart; adopt a CLI on your computer into Lark with `/adopt` and continue on your phone; click "🔑 Get operate link" to get a writable Web Terminal when you need to take action.
- **Always-on + auto-start**: deploy on an always-on dev machine / server, and configure `botmux autostart enable` to auto-recover on restart.
- **Clean up promptly**: `/close` a session when you're done with it; if they pile up, batch-close them in the Dashboard or run `botmux delete stopped` to clear out zombies.
