/**
 * Smoke-test a compiled Bun single-file botmux binary.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the release job used to smoke-test the binary with
 * `capabilities --json` alone. That is a static feature-flag document — it
 * proves the CLI module graph loads, and NOTHING about the parts the Bun
 * migration actually breaks. Two real regressions shipped past it:
 *   • the dashboard crashlooped in the compiled binary because a deep
 *     `require('qrcode-terminal/vendor/QRCode')` was never embedded, and
 *   • the dashboard was not launched at all (no supervisor member for it).
 * Both were invisible to `capabilities --json`. This script exercises the
 * layers that carry real risk under `bun build --compile`:
 *
 *   1. capabilities   — CLI graph loads at all (cheap canary, kept).
 *   1b. version       — the binary reports its own version rather than the
 *                       `unknown` sentinel. Compiled mode has no package.json on
 *                       disk, so every version read failed and 3.18.0-canary.2
 *                       shipped printing `botmux vunknown`.
 *   2. self-spawn     — the `__supervisor` hidden entry re-execs THIS binary
 *                       (the /$bunfs argv[1] path), starts a fleet, and the
 *                       supervisor stays alive.
 *   3. dashboard      — the supervisor spawns the `__dashboard` member, it
 *                       BOOTS (embedded qrcode vendor tree resolves) and
 *                       reaches `online` in fleet-state instead of crashlooping.
 *   4. http listen    — that dashboard actually serves (a response, any status,
 *                       proves the server bound rather than the process merely
 *                       existing).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered: anything needing Feishu credentials or a real bot.
 * Everything here runs against an empty `bots.json` in a scratch HOME, so it is
 * safe on a CI runner and on a developer machine.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/smoke-bun-binary.mjs <path-to-binary>
 * Exit 0 = all checks passed; non-zero + a diagnostic on the first failure.
