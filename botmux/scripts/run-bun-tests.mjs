// Run the unit suite on `bun test` — the only runner that executes test BODIES
// on Bun. `vitest` forks Node workers even when launched via `bun x vitest`
// (measured), so Bun-specific behaviour (its `fetch` error taxonomy, the
// startup-frozen `os.homedir()`, `Bun.file`, compiled-binary paths) is invisible
// to `bun run test` and can only regress silently there.
//
// ONE FILE PER PROCESS, deliberately. `bun test a.ts b.ts …` runs every file in
// a SINGLE process (measured: two files report the same `process.pid`), unlike
// vitest which forks a worker per file. Handing it the whole suite produces
// cascading cross-file interference rather than real failures — measured on this
// repo: 1010 files batched → 933 failures; the same files one-per-process → ~2%
// red; and individual victims (`fleet-supervisor.integration`,
// `ask-custom-reply-candidate`, `dashboard-ipc`) go 23/23, 8/8 and 170/171 green
// in isolation while failing in the batch. A `vi.mock` of a shared module (e.g.
// `utils/logger`) installed by one file stays installed for later files, so a
// deliberately partial mock in file A becomes a `logger.isDebug is not a
// function` crash in file Z. Per-process execution restores the isolation
// boundary vitest gives for free.
//
// The cost is process startup per file (~21 min wall clock for this suite versus
// a few minutes batched). That is the price of trustworthy results; a leg whose
// failures are mostly artefacts is worse than no leg at all.
//
// A subset of files cannot run here yet: `vi.doMock` / `vi.doUnmock` /
// `vi.resetModules`, the `importOriginal` / `importActual` mock-factory callbacks,
// and `vi.hoisted` are module-registry or transform semantics, not missing
// functions. `test/bun-test-shim.ts` deliberately does NOT fake them — a fake
// would report success while silently not mocking (or, for `hoisted`, run the
// factory too late), which is worse than the current red. Those files keep running
// under vitest until they are rewritten to use dependency injection.
//
// The exclusion list is COMPUTED, never hardcoded: a stale literal list would
// quietly start skipping files (or fail on files that have since been fixed).
