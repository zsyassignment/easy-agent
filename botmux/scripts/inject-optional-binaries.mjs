/**
 * Release-time injection of the platform-binary `optionalDependencies` into the
 * MAIN package's package.json, immediately before `npm pack`/`publish`.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT JUST CHECKED INTO package.json ─────────────────────────────
 * Two independent reasons, both measured rather than assumed:
 *
 * 1. `bun install --frozen-lockfile` would fail on every CI job. Adding the four
 *    entries to package.json without regenerating bun.lock produces:
 *      error: lockfile had changes, but lockfile is frozen
 *    Verified by reproducing it in a scratch package. Every workflow in this repo
 *    installs with --frozen-lockfile, so a committed-but-unlocked optional dep
 *    turns the whole pipeline red.
 *
 * 2. The versions must equal the release version, and `npm version` does NOT
 *    rewrite dependency ranges — verified: bumping a package to 9.9.9 left its
 *    `optionalDependencies` pinned at "0.0.0". Since the subpackages are published
 *    at the tag's version, a committed "0.0.0" would point at a version that never
 *    exists, npm would silently skip the optional dep (that is what optional
 *    means), and the launcher would find no binary — the exact silent degradation
 *    this whole change exists to remove.
 *
 * Injecting at release time solves both: the lockfile never sees these entries,
 * and the version is whatever the tag says. `npm pack` picks up the mutation from
 * disk (verified: the four entries and the synced version appear inside the packed
 * tarball's package/package.json).
 *
 * Idempotent: running twice with the same version is a no-op.
 *
 *   usage: node scripts/inject-optional-binaries.mjs <version>

/**
 * The platform subpackages, matching packages/binary-<platform>-<arch>[-musl]/.
 *
 * The two `-musl` entries are load-bearing for Alpine: npm chooses among optional
 * platform deps by `os`/`cpu`/`libc`, and `libc` is the ONLY field that separates a
 * musl host from a glibc one (both report linux/x64). Publishing the musl
 * subpackages without listing them here leaves them on the registry with nothing
 * referencing them — npm never even considers them, and Alpine falls back to the
 * glibc package, which cannot exec.
