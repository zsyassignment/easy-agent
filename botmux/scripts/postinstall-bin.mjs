/**
 * postinstall: point the single global `botmux` launcher at the platform binary.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The old model was `bin: {botmux: dist/cli.js}` with a `#!/usr/bin/env node`
 * shebang, so the CLI ran on whatever Node resolved first. With two Node versions
 * installed, each carries its OWN global botmux and users could not tell which one
 * `botmux` meant or which one an update touched. The fix: ship the self-contained
 * Bun single-file executable (its own runtime embedded, no Node needed) via npm
 * optional platform subpackages, and have exactly ONE launcher point at it.
 *
 * npm installs only the subpackage whose `os`/`cpu` match (that is what optional
 * platform deps do), so we look up whichever one actually landed and write a
 * launcher that `exec`s its binary.
 *
 * ── THE GUARD (do not loosen this) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * We only write the launcher for a REAL global install. Empirically measured what
 * each package manager exposes to postinstall (not assumed — probed every case):
 *
 *   `npm i -g botmux`                    → npm_config_global === "true"
 *   installed as someone's local dep     → npm_config_global ABSENT
 *   `pnpm install` INSIDE the botmux repo → npm_config_global ABSENT
 *   `bun add -g botmux`                  → npm_config_global ABSENT (see below)
 *
 * The third case is the dangerous one: a repo-local `pnpm install` DOES run the
 * root package's postinstall. So a `!== "false"` style check would fire during
 * ordinary development and rewrite ~/.botmux/bin/botmux — hijacking the global
 * launcher of whatever fleet shares that HOME (on the dev box that is ~50 live
 * daemons). Hence the env check stays a STRICT `=== "true"`, and there is a second,
 * independent bail-out when we can see we are inside the source checkout.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FOURTH CASE IS WHY THE ENV CHECK ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. Bun does pass a few
 * npm_* vars to lifecycle scripts — MEASURED with a probe package whose postinstall
 * dumped its own env, the complete set is:
 *
 *   BUN_INSTALL, BUN_WHICH_IGNORE_CWD, npm_config_user_agent, npm_execpath,
 *   npm_node_execpath
 *
 * — but `npm_config_global` is NOT among them, and that is the one this guard read.
 * So for a perfectly real `bun add -g botmux` the check failed and this script
 * exited 0 without writing anything. MEASURED end to end: `.bun/bin/` empty, no
 * launcher, the platform binary sitting in the download cache, i.e. the user had NO
 * `botmux` command at all. Worse, the obvious workaround did NOT help: `bun pm -g
 * trust botmux` made bun report `1 script ran` while this script still wrote
 * nothing, because the env check had already failed.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO SEPARATE LAYERS — do not conflate them. (a) bun BLOCKS the script by
 * default (`Blocked N postinstalls`); `bun pm trust` lifts that. (b) even once it
 * runs, this guard killed it. Fixing (b) is what makes `bun pm trust` an actually
 * working workaround. pnpm 10/11 is a different layer again: `onlyBuiltDependencies`
 * means the script does not run at all, so this fix alone does not rescue pnpm —
 * that needs approve-builds/onlyBuiltDependencies or a different mechanism.
 *
 * So the global check is: the env says global (npm/yarn), OR THE INSTALL LOCATION
 * ITSELF says global. The layout list is INLINED in `locationSaysGlobal` below —
 * see the ⚠️ notes there for why importing the repo's classifier from `dist/` was
 * dead code in the published package, and why the inlined version is deliberately
 * stricter on Windows. A source checkout matches no global layout (verified), so
 * this cannot reopen the repo-local hijack that guard 2 also covers.
 *
 * ── FAIL HARD WHEN THERE IS NO BINARY ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * This used to warn and exit 0, because `bin: {botmux: "dist/cli.js"}` gave every
 * failure a Node fallback to land on. That fallback is gone (it forced the main
 * package to depend on node-pty, which has no linux prebuild and so pulled a whole
 * node-gyp toolchain into every `npm i -g` — an install-time requirement that
 * simply is not met on many machines). With no fallback, exiting 0 without a
 * launcher would leave the user with a `botmux` command that does not exist, and
 * they would find out later with a confusing error. So: no binary → fail the
 * install, loudly, with the reason.
 *
 * The GUARD cases below still exit 0 silently — those are not failures, they are
 * "this is not a global install, there is nothing to do".

/**
 * Are we on a musl libc distro (Alpine and most slim Docker images)?
 *
 * WHY THIS CHECK EXISTS: npm selects platform subpackages by `os`/`cpu`, and both
 * are identical for glibc and musl (`linux`/`x64`), so on Alpine npm happily
 * installs `botmux-linux-x64` — a glibc-linked binary that dies at exec time with a
 * loader error naming no cause. Without this check we would write a launcher
 * pointing at a binary that cannot run: the worst outcome, because the install
 * "succeeds" and the failure surfaces much later.
 *
 * (npm does support a `libc` field — undocumented in `npm help package-json` but
 * live in the wild, e.g. `@napi-rs/canvas-linux-x64-musl` publishes `libc: musl`.
 * Once botmux ships musl subpackages declaring it, npm will pick the right one on
 * its own and this guard becomes a diagnostic for "the musl package failed to
 * install" rather than "musl is unsupported".)
 *
 * Detection order is authoritative-first, and deliberately conservative: only claim
 * musl when positively observed, so a glibc box is never blocked by a false
 * positive.
 *
 * MEASURED on node:22-alpine: `process.report.getReport().header` has 23 keys and
 * carries NEITHER `glibcVersionRuntime` NOR any musl key. So the report is only
 * useful as a NEGATIVE signal ("glibcVersionRuntime present ⇒ definitely glibc,
 * stop"); on musl it tells us nothing and the loader probe below is what actually
 * decides. Do not add a `header.musl` branch back — Node does not publish one.

/**
 * Does the install LOCATION say this is a package-manager-owned global tree?
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS IS INLINED INSTEAD OF IMPORTING THE REPO'S CLASSIFIER. The first
 * version did `await import('./dist/utils/global-install.js')` to reuse
 * `detectGlobalInstallManager`. That was DEAD CODE in the published package: #1115
 * removed `dist/` from `package.json` `files`, so the import always ENOENTs, the
 * catch returned false, and the guard silently fell back to env-only — leaving
 * `bun add -g botmux` exactly as broken as before. MEASURED, not reasoned:
 *
 *   git archive origin/master | tar x && npm pack
 *   tar tzf botmux-*.tgz | grep -c '^package/dist/'    → 0
 *
 * and end to end, a real `bun add -g <that tarball>` then running this script the
 * way bun does: exit 0, no launcher. This file is a standalone script with no build
 * step, and neither `dist/` nor `src/` is published, so being SELF-CONTAINED is its
 * natural form — inlining is not a compromise here.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS DELIBERATELY STRICTER THAN `detectGlobalInstallManager`. That
 * function ends with `platform === 'win32' ? 'npm' : 'unknown'`, so on Windows it
 * cannot tell a global install from a LOCAL dependency — MEASURED:
 *
 *   detectGlobalInstallManager('C:/projects/myapp/node_modules/botmux', 'win32') → 'npm'
 *
 * Harmless where it is used today (a wrong `npm i -g` merely reinstalls), but in
 * THIS file it would mean a Windows local dependency repoints the shared
 * `~/.botmux/bin/botmux` — the exact hijack guard 1 exists to prevent. So the list
 * below recognises only KNOWN GLOBAL layouts and has no platform fallback. Windows
 * npm globals are unaffected: they arrive with `npm_config_global=true` and never
 * reach this check.
 *
 * The layout patterns mirror `detectGlobalInstallManager`'s; a source guard in
 * test/npm-binary-distribution.test.ts pins the two in agreement over a matrix of
 * real global paths, so the duplication cannot drift unnoticed.

// only way this launcher becomes a command; we now write the right startup file
// for the user's actual shell (bash/zsh/fish/other) and tell them what we did.
//
// ⚠️ DO NOT GATE THIS ON `process.env.PATH`. It used to be wrapped in
// `if (!process.env.PATH.split(':').includes(binDir))`, which asks "is binDir on
// the PATH of the process running the install?" — the wrong question. What decides
// whether `botmux` works is whether the user's FUTURE shells get it, i.e. whether a
// startup file says so. The two come apart whenever the installing shell has binDir
// on PATH transiently, and botmux itself creates that situation: the daemon
// prepends `~/.botmux/bin` to every CLI session's PATH (five `prependBotmuxBin`
// call sites in worker.ts / worker-pool.ts). So `npm i -g botmux` run from inside a
// botmux session — or any shell that merely exported the dir — wrote NO startup
// file, printed NO hint, and exited 0; the next terminal then had no `botmux` at
// all, because there is no `bin` field to fall back on. MEASURED with the real
// script against an isolated HOME, changing only PATH:
//   PATH without binDir → writes ~/.zshenv + "open a new terminal" hint
//   PATH with    binDir → zero files, zero output, exit 0   ← the reported bug
// `ensurePathEntry` already asks the right question per file (`fileAlreadyHasEntry`,
// which also recognises a line the user wrote by hand) and reports those as
// `skipped`, so this outer check was redundant as well as wrong.
//
// ⚠️ FAIL-SOFT, and never `fail()`: the launcher is already installed and working
// at this point, so a PATH edit that cannot happen must degrade to the printed
// hint — not abort a successful install. That includes the sibling module simply
// not being there: it ships via package.json `files`, and if a future edit drops
// it (or a mirror repacks the tarball without it) the import throws. Guarding it
// keeps `npm i -g botmux` succeeding either way.
